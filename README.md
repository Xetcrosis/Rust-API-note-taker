# Rust-API-note-taker

## Description

This is a rust project for my grandpa! He goes down to a prison to teach the bible to inmates every saturday
and I remember watching him get his note ready one saturday. Watching him hop from window to window and site to site on a already slow computer just to get a couple of versus he wanted made me think that i could make the process easier. His 70th birthday was 1/30/24 and I wasnt able to give this to him then, but better late than never.

The goal of this rust app is to create a windows application that allows you to search ![This Bible API](https://scripture.api.bible/) not only for specific versus and books but also *by* a specific version of the bible, allowing you to take scripture and inject it directly into a note page adjacent to the scripture box.
